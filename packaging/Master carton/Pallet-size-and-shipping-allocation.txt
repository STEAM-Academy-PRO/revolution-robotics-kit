Shipping cost:
- The shipping cost (regardless of air shipment or sea shipment) is based on volume & weight.
- 1 cbm (cubic meter) counts as 167kgs.
- The shipping company calculates the cost based on the larger number: 
  - Either the weight of the product
  - Or the packaging size compared to weight (1 cubic meter = 167kg).
- In general, the less pallet we ship, the less shipping charge will be.
