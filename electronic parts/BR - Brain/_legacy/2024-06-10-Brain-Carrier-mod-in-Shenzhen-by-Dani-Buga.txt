HM5166 can not be turned off - there is a body diode inside that conducts when EN is low.
Recommended solution:
- Connect `VBAT` to `S1 pin 3`
- Remove R19
- Connect `S1 pin 3` to VBAT (instead of NC)
- Connect L3, C113, C72, C75 to `S1 pin 2` (PWR_EN instead of VBAT)
- Connect R97 to `S1 pin 2` (PWR_EN instead of VBAT)
